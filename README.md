# LEADSCORE
**Objective:**
X Education is an online education company targeting industry professionals. They face challenges with their lead conversion process, with only around 30% of leads converting into customers. To improve this, they aim to identify "Hot Leads" with the highest conversion potential. This involves developing a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead, enabling the company to focus their sales efforts more effectively.

**Context:**
X Education attracts leads through various channels, such as website visits, form submissions, and referrals. Once acquired, these leads are contacted by the sales team through calls and emails. However, most leads do not convert, highlighting the need for a systematic approach to identify the most promising leads.

**Challenges:**
1. **Low Conversion Rate:** The company's current lead conversion rate is approximately 30%, which they want to improve.
2. **Lead Prioritization:** They need to identify leads with the highest likelihood of conversion, enabling the sales team to prioritize their efforts.
3. **Future Adaptability:** The model should be adaptable to future changes and challenges in the lead generation and conversion process.

**Solution:**
To address these challenges, we will build a logistic regression model that assigns lead scores based on the probability of conversion. Higher scores will indicate "Hot Leads" with a greater likelihood of converting, while lower scores will represent "Cold Leads" less likely to convert. This model will help X Education optimize their lead conversion process, potentially increasing their conversion rate.

Additionally, we will address other specific problems and requirements provided by the company, ensuring that the logistic regression model can accommodate these needs in the future. These details will be integrated into our final presentation to provide comprehensive recommendations.

In summary, our goal is to develop a predictive lead scoring model that empowers X Education to focus their sales efforts on the most promising leads, ultimately improving their lead conversion rate and overall business efficiency.
